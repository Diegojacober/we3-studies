The easiest way to enable one contract to interact with another is by defining the target contract. Interfaces serve this purpose; for example:

interface IToken {
    function getBalance(address user) external;
}
 We can use this interface to properly communicate with a token contract that implements the getBalance method:

// tokenAddress: a contract adddress we want to communicate with
// userAddress: the address we want to lookup the balance for
uint balance = IToken(tokenAddress).getBalance(userAddress);
Behind the scenes Solidity is creating a message call that encodes the calldata for this getBalance call.
